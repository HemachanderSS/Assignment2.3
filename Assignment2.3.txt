1.Component of Hadoop 1.x:
	There are total 5 components in Hadoop 1.x architecture
	*Name Node(NN)
	*Data Node(DN)
	*Secondary Name Node(SNN)
	*Job Tracker(JT)
	*Task Tracker(TT)
*Name Node:
	1.The job of name node is to decide,how to store the physical location of each and
every file in blocks in the cluster.
	2.It manages the metadata of the files stored in Data nodes.
	3.Name node also decides by combining which all physical locations in the data nodes.
	4.Name node always stores the metadata in FSImage and EditLogs file at regular intervals.

*Data Node:
	1.Data node will store the file data in blocks.
	2.It will send the RPC signal at regular interval to notify the name node that it is alive
and working.

*Secondary Name Node:
	1.It acts as a backup for Name node.
	2.It stores the meta data information from name node at regular interval as per checkpoint 
mechanism.
	3.When name node goes down in that case SNN comes into picture and acts as a
temporary name node till name node becomes active again.
	

*Job Tracker:
	It is also called as Single Point of Failure(SPOF).
	1.Most of times resides in the same node as of name node.
	2.It's job is to assign the task to the Data nodes.
	3.it also decides the job scheduling for the data nodes.
	4.In case of job failure,it decides about the rescheduling of the task on some other
nodes.

*Task Tracker:
	Task tracker job is to execute the task assigned by job tracker.
